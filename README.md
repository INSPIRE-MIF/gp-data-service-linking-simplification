# Good Practice: Data and Service Linking Simplification
This repository includes the output of the work of the temporary sub-group of the INSPIRE MIG, aimed to create a Good Practice for a consensus-based simplified approach for INSPIRE data-service linkages.

## Context & issue
The current level of accessibility of INSPIRE data sets through view and download services is low. One of the reasons are problems with implementing the data-service linking approach currently described in the TGs for metadata and network services, which is considered complicated and partly ambiguous, even by implementation/standards experts. Many organisations are therefore facing difficulties to provide implementations in line with these requirements, which in turn has reflects negatively on the overall usability of the INSPIRE infrastructure, as shown by the low values (on average) of the Monitoring indicators about the data set accessibility.

## Scope of the work
This work, framed within [Action 2.3 "Simplification of INSPIRE implementation"](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2.3+Simplification+of+INSPIRE+implementation) of the [INSPIRE MIWP 2021-2024](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24), aims to develop a shared, consensus-based approach for the simplification of data-service linking that is proven to be implementable by de facto standard web applications, to be further submitted as an INSPIRE Good Practice. The new approach will be alternative to (not substituting) the current approach which is already recognised by the INSPIRE Geoportal.

This work is coordinated by the JRC and involves representatives of the following Member States: AT, DE, DK, EL, FR, NL, PL and SE.
